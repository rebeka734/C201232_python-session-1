This Python script is designed to teach you the basics of variables and data types in Python.
We will cover:
1. What variables are and how to use them.
2. The basic data types in Python.
3. Variable naming conventions and industry standards.
4. Python's dynamic typing feature.

Each section includes explanations, examples, and assignments to reinforce your learning.

# Section 1: Variables
# ---------------------
# Variables are containers for storing data values. In Python, a variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

# Example 1: Creating Variables
x = 5
y = "Hello, Python learners!"

# You can print the variables to see their values.
# print(x)
# print(y)

# Assignment 1: Create two variables, one holding a number and the other holding your name. Then print both.
my_number = 32
my_name = "REBEKA SULTANA"
# Print the variables
print("Number:", my_number)
print("Name:", my_name)

# Section 2: Data Types
# ---------------------
# Python has various data types including integers, float (decimal numbers), strings, booleans, and more.

# Example 2: Data Types
a = 5               # int
b = 3.14            # float
c = "Python"        # str
d = True            # bool

# You can check the type of any variable by using the type() function.
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
print(type(d))

# Assignment 2: Create variables of different types and use the type() function to check their types.
# Creating variables of different types
integer_var = 10            # Integer
float_var = 3.14            # Float
string_var = "Hello, World" # String
boolean_var = True          # Boolean
list_var = [1, 2, 3]        # List
tuple_var = (4, 5, 6)       # Tuple
dict_var = {"key": "value"} # Dictionary
set_var = {7, 8, 9}         # Set

# Using type() function to check their types
print("Type of integer_var:", type(integer_var))
print("Type of float_var:", type(float_var))
print("Type of string_var:", type(string_var))
print("Type of boolean_var:", type(boolean_var))
print("Type of list_var:", type(list_var))
print("Type of tuple_var:", type(tuple_var))
print("Type of dict_var:", type(dict_var))
print("Type of set_var:", type(set_var))



# Section 3: Variable Naming Conventions and Industry Standards
# -------------------------------------------------------------
"""
Variable names should be:
- Clear, descriptive & relevant.
- Start with a letter or an underscore.
- Only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _).
- Case-sensitive (age, Age, and AGE are different variables).

Industry standards often follow the 'snake_case' naming style for variables in Python.
"""

# Example 3: Good and Bad Variable Names
good_name = "John"
_bad_name = 23
# 2bad = 42  # This will raise a SyntaxError because variable names cannot begin with a number.

# Assignment 3: Fix the bad variable name above and create three more variables with good naming practices.
good_name = "John"
_bad_name = 23
bad_variable_name = 42  # Fixed variable name

# Creating three more variables with good naming practices
user_age = 30
is_active = True
favorite_color = "Blue"

# Printing the variables to verify
print("Good Name:", good_name)
print("Bad Name (fixed):", bad_variable_name)
print("User Age:", user_age)
print("Is Active:", is_active)
print("Favorite Color:", favorite_color)


# Section 4: Python's Dynamic Typing
# ----------------------------------
# Python is dynamically typed, which means you donâ€™t have to declare the type of variable while declaring it.

# Example 4: Dynamic Typing
var = "I am a string"
print(var)

var = 42
print(var)

# The variable 'var' changes type from str to int, demonstrating Python's dynamic typing.

# Assignment 4: Create a variable, assign it a value of one type, then reassign it to a different type and print both.
# Creating a variable and assigning it a value of one type
dynamic_var = "This is a string"
print("Initial value:", dynamic_var)
print("Type of dynamic_var:", type(dynamic_var))

# Reassigning the variable to a different type
dynamic_var = 12345
print("\nReassigned value:", dynamic_var)
print("Type of dynamic_var:", type(dynamic_var))


# Congratulations on completing this part of the Python workshop!
# Review the assignments, try to solve them, and check your understanding of variables and data types.
